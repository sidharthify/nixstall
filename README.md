# nixstall
A small personal script for my NixOS setup. It appends package names to my `packages.nix` automatically, so I donâ€™t have to open and edit it every time I want to install something. It basically acts like a lightweight package manager wrapper for any distro that manages packages through editable config files instead of commands.
